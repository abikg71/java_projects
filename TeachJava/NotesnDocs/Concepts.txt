public class HelloWorld{
public static void main(String[] args){}
}

/*
Line1 Defines a class. Every Java program must have at least one class
Each class has a name.
By Convention, class names starts with an uppercase letter.
In our case the class Name is HelloWorld.

line2 Defines the main method.
In order to run a class, the class must cointain a method named main.
The program is executed from the main method.

Every statement in java ends with a semicolon(;).
Known as a the statement Terminator.

Reserved words, keywords have a specific meaning to the complier AND Can not be used for other purpose in the program

public, static, void,

COMMENT
// in line comment
/**/ a block comment
When a complier sees a any of those (// or /**/) it ignores all texts between /**/ or // line

BRACES
Each block pf program begins with an opeing brace ({ ) and ends with closing brace (}).

          IMPORT
          import java.util.Scanner;
          import java.util.*;

There are two types of import statement.
specific impprt and wild card import.

The specific import specifies a single class in the import statement.
Example import java.util.Scanner;

The wild card import imports all the classes in the package.
Example  import java.util.*;
  The wildcard can import more than one class/library/package
  In util.*
          Scanner     Calender  Date  Timezone
           Currency   Random  Vector      Array .....etc
   mport java.util.Random;

Built-in Packages
These packages consist of a large number of classes which are a part of Java API.Some of the commonly used built-in packages are:
1) java.lang: Contains language support classes(e.g classed which defines primitive data types, math operations). This package is automatically imported.
2)  java.io: Contains classed for supporting input / output operations.
3)  java.util: Contains utility classes which implement data structures like Linked List, Dictionary and support ; for Date / Time operations.
4)  java.applet: Contains classes for creating Applets.
5)  java.awt: Contain classes for implementing the components for graphical user interfaces (like button , ;menus etc).
6)  java.net: Contain classes for supporting networking operations.

System.in Vs System.out

In java we use System.in to standard input device [Keyboard]

You can use SCANNER class to CREATE an object to read input from System.in as follow

Scanner input = new Scanner(System.in);

System.out to refer to the standard output device. [monitor]/Console

To perform console output we use println method to dispay a message



              Variable
Variabledesignates a location in a memory for storing data.

Every Variable has a name, a type, a size, and a value.
Example double taxRate = 8.345;

Using descriptive names for Variables


Concatenating Strings
Concatenating strings with number (?)

      print vs println

print and println are identical in functionality
The only difference is Println moves the cursor to the next line after displaying the string,

How do you do it??
