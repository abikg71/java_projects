In this part of the course we will cover the following:

What Java n why do we care about it?

Data types in Java

  Double          float             More
Operators in Java +, - /, *, %,
                  &&, ||, ==, !=,
How do we use constants in Java
    pi = 3. 141.., e = 2.78 .., gravity = 9.8 , and more

How do we perform arithmetic operations
  Example: 10.5 + 2 *3 / 45-3

Conditional statements
  if
  if else
  else
  Switch statements
        case
        break
        default
        break and contiue

Loops
    for loop, while loop, do while

Methods creating reusable code

Logic
    As we all know the doctors are required to measure the body temp of person
    to get started to know whether a person is infected with COVID-19 or not.
    So they need to know a person's name, and age, his temp.

As Programmer you are asked to write a program which helps doctors in gathering a
 patient info and come up with some sort of user name for a patient and more on next class

Approach
BAsicsformuleG4'
Create a new project and name it  'Java'

Create a file named DataTypes and write a program which asks user to Enter his

a), full name (first ,last name)
b, date of birth it doesn't has to be the actual DOB.
c). favorite color.
d). Add at least two numbers at the end of the user name and use Random Math function
 to generate the numbers


Display out the user Entered information on the console/screen,
some thing like the ff:
  Your user name is abinetn49
  Your age is 26
  your body tem in degree  Celsius is: ??
  your body tem in degree Fahrenheit is: ??

  You need to see a doctor because.... is ?? in C


# Takeaway

 String: Strings are defined as an array of characters. The difference between a character array and a string is the string is terminated with a special character ‘\0’.
Below is the basic syntax for declaring a string in Java programming language.
