# Objective of today's meeting is:
1. What is Terminal/Command Line(CDL)?
      Why we need it
      In order to learn and explain Terminal/CDL
      => Search for terminal on mac/ cmd on Windows

      To create a folder on the Desktop from terminal/command line
      type cd Desktop ~ Now you are on Desktop folder.
       -> mkdir BasicsofTerminal this creates folder called BasicsofTerminal

  -> Now cd BasicsofTerminal  and now you're on Desktop/basicsofTerminal folder
          -> vim basicsofTerminal.txt == creates a file named "basicsofTerminal.txt"
          click i for  insert/write for our context.
          Type the following
              # Well come to Grace consulting and Integration services.
              # We are so happy to have you in the course, so let us do it

        ONCE you are done click esc : wq which saves and exits you from writing
        Now close your terminal n open it back
        cd Desktop; ls;cd basicsofTerminal; ,ls; Now you can see the file you create exists /Users/abiken/Desktop/basicsofTerminal.
